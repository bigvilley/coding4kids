# Coding Resources for Kids

A curated list of resources for teaching coding to children, from ages 5 upwards. Suggest links in the comments below.

## Early Years

- [“Make a Sandwich” game](http://blog.craigs.me/2014-11-18-comfort-zone.html#following-instructions) - A simple game where the class has to instruct a computer (the teacher) to make a ham sandwich. This introduces the idea of computers following instructions. Here's [another example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leBEFaVHllE).
- [Hello Ruby](http://www.helloruby.com/) - Various activities, including making a remote control to control your friends.
- [Bee-Bot Floor Robot](http://www.tts-group.co.uk/shops/tts/Products/PD1723538/Bee-Bot-Floor-Robot/) - Programmable robots that can be used to introduce sequencing and following instructions.
  - [Bee-Bot App](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bee-bot/id500131639) - An iPad version.
- [Coding For Kids: Without a Computer](http://www.science-sparks.com/2015/01/19/coding-kids/) - A collection of activities away from a computer that encourage and teach basic computing concepts.

## Key Stage 1 (5-7 Years)

- [Hopscotch](http://www.gethopscotch.com/) - An iPad app for creating simple games and apps by dragging and dropping colourful blocks and images.
  - [Basic Edition](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hopscotch-programming-for/id617098629) - Free, but there are in-app purchases to acquire new characters.
  - [School Edition](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hopscotch-school-edition-programming/id901455276) - Costs £7.99, but has all characters unlocked.
- [ScratchJr](http://www.scratchjr.org/) - A simplified, trimmed down version of _Scratch_. Only on iPad.
- [Run Marco!](https://www.allcancode.com/) - An adventure game in which you must give an intrepid explorer sequences of instructions to reach crystals. It offers a nice step-by-step mode where you can run the instructions one at a time to work out where you went wrong.
- [Lego](http://www.lego.com/) - Any Lego set could be used to introduce the concept of following a set of step-by-step instructions like a computer does.
- [Robot Turtles](http://www.robotturtles.com/) - Board game for kids to learn basic programming concepts. Focuses on sequencing. [Purchase on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ThinkFun-Robot-Turtles-Board-Game/dp/B00HN2BXUY).
- [Nina and the Neurons: Go Digital](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/games/nina-go-digital-game) - A series of short games that introduce the basics of sequencing and building up rules. There is also a special series of _Nina and the Neurons_ programmes on CBeebies that focus specifically on computing.

## Key Stage 2 (7-11 Years)

- [Code Kingdoms](http://codekingdoms.com/) - An adventure style game, similar to _Run Marco!_, with a level editor for creating your own adventures.
- [Code Monkey Island](http://codemonkeyplanet.com/) - Another board game for basic programming concepts. Combines aspects such as conditionals, loops, assignment, and strategic thinking. (Appears to be US-only, but waiting to find out if they ship to the UK).
- [Technobabble](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/games/make-it-technobabble-game-maker) - An online app by the _BBC_ for creating simple games by plugging together different actions and rules.
  - [Tutorial Videos](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/topics/make-it-tutorials) - Follow two short videos to learn how to make a simple _Asteroids_ clone.
- [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) - A nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children.
- [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) - A online-only app, much like _Hopscotch_ but far more in-depth in the scope and possibilities.
- [Hour of Code](http://code.org/learn) - Much like _Scratch_ and _Hopscotch_, using a blocks based structure, but with a series of short exercises to introduce concepts gradually, using well known characters.
- [Shaun the Sheep’s Game Academy](http://shaunsgameacademy.co.uk/) - A series of video tutorials and _Scratch_ projects.
- [Cargo-Bot](http://twolivesleft.com/CargoBot/) - An iPad game in which you program a series of robots to move crates to solve puzzles. Created using _Codea_.

## Key Stage 3+ (11 Years+)

- [Codea](http://twolivesleft.com/Codea/) - An iPad app for making any app you can think of. Some of the qualities of Hopscotch and Scratch, but at a much higher level, introducing text-based programming using the _Lua_ language.
- [JavaScript for Kids](http://www.nostarch.com/javascriptforkids), _by Nick Morgan_ - an introduction to JavaScript that teaches programming essentials through patient, step-by-step examples paired with funny illustrations.
- [Learn to Program with Minecraft Plugins ](https://pragprog.com/book/ahmine2/learn-to-program-with-minecraft-plugins)
- [Greenfoot](ttp://www.greenfoot.org/overview) - An interactive _Java_ development environment for simple two-dimensional applications.
- [Kids Ruby](http://kidsruby.com/) - A basic _Ruby_ development environment for creating simple command-line applications.
- [Let's Make a Mario Game](http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/test/PjsGameEngine/docs/tutorial/mario.html) - An excellent in-depth tutorial showing how to use the _Processing.js_ library to make a Mario game that runs in a web browser.

## For Teachers

- [Computing ITT & CPD](https://sites.google.com/site/primaryictitt/) - A curated collection of resources for use by those training teachers to deliver the new primary computing curriculum
- [Espresso Coding](http://www.espressocoding.co.uk/) - An entire course (including supporting materials) for teaching coding to all ages. Requires a paid subscription.

## General Reading

- [Programming Literacy: Why Every Kid Should Learn To Code](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/programming-literacy-7bc4ae154b91), by _Eric Elliott_ - A extremely eloquent piece about how we're standing at a junction, looming towards a future where a lack of programming literacy has devastating consequences.
- [Have We Got It All Horribly Wrong?](http://www.codingclub.co.uk/blog.php#2) - A very frank article discussing the merits of introducing KS1 children to coding, questioning whether it's too young and potentially detrimental.
- [Today We Made a Computer Game](http://blog.craigs.me/2015-01-10-today-we-made-a-computer-game.html) - My account of introducing my own children (who are 3 and 5) to programming one wet and windy afternoon.
- [Tips On Making Sure All Staff Are Ready To Teach Coding](http://ukedchat.com/2014/02/27/session-191-coding-coding-coding-tips-on-making-sure-all-staff-are-ready-to-teach-coding/) - Notes from a #UKEdChat twitter session where teachers share their concerns and experiences regarding teaching coding.

## Teaching Ideas

- _School App Store_: Setup a website where children can upload their creations to share with classmates. It would be sort of like a mini app-store for the school. They could even charge a small fee or ask for donations and give any money raised to charity.
- _Blindfolded Obstacle Course_: Mark out a simple course using cones. Then one pupil is blindfolded and the rest of the class has to give instructions to that pupil to help them through the course.
- _After-school Workshops_: Children can come along with ideas for things they'd like to make and get some one-on-one time to help them figure out.
