# Others
- Math
  - The underlying concepts of software comes from Math. To go deeply in CS, we get familiar with Math.
  - You can learn the from courses in [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) to university-level in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- Physics and Electronic Engineering
  - The computer hardware is built for implementing the software. The better you know how how it works, the better you can write the efficient programs.
  - [circuitlab](https://www.circuitlab.com/) is worth trying.
  - [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) provides many kits for electronic hobbyist to build their own toys.
