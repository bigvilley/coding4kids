This is just a dumping ground for links that I come across and ideas that I come up with (or that I've stolen from others) for teaching coding to children of primary school age. I'm making this list public so that others can contribute and we can all benefit.

## For Teachers

- [Espresso Coding](http://www.espressocoding.co.uk/) - Entire courses and materials for teaching coding to all ages.

## Key Stage 1 (5-7 Years)

- [“Make a Sandwich” game](http://blog.craigs.me/2014-11-18-comfort-zone.html#following-instructions) - A simple game where the class has to instruct a computer (the teacher) to make a ham sandwich.
- [Hello Ruby](http://www.helloruby.com/) - Various activities, including making a remote control to control your friends.
- [Hopscotch](http://www.gethopscotch.com/) - An iPad-only app for creating simple games and apps by dragging and dropping colourful blocks and images.
- [Run Marco!](https://www.allcancode.com/) - An adventure game in which you must give an intrepid explorer sequences of instructions to reach crystals. It offers a nice step-by-step mode where you can run the instructions one at a time to work out where you went wrong.

## Key Stage 2 (7-11 Years)

- [Technobabble](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/games/make-it-technobabble-game-maker) - An online app by the BBC for creating simple games by plugging together different actions and rules.
- [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) - A nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children.
- [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) - A online-only app, much like Hopscotch but far more in-depth in the scope and possibilities.
- [Shaun the Sheep’s Game Academy](http://shaunsgameacademy.co.uk/) - A series of video tutorials and Scratch projects.

## Key Stage 3+

- [JavaScript for Kids](http://www.nostarch.com/javascriptforkids) _by Nick Morgan_ - an introduction to JavaScript that teaches programming essentials through patient, step-by-step examples paired with funny illustrations.
- [Learn to Program with Minecraft Plugins ](https://pragprog.com/book/ahmine2/learn-to-program-with-minecraft-plugins)
- [Greenfoot](ttp://www.greenfoot.org/overview)
- [Kids Ruby](http://kidsruby.com/)

## General Reading

- [Have we got it all horribly wrong?](http://www.codingclub.co.uk/blog.php#2) - A very frank article discussing the merits of introducing KS1 children to coding, questioning whether it's too young and potentially detrimental.
- [Today We Made a Computer Game](http://blog.craigs.me/2015-01-10-today-we-made-a-computer-game.html) - My account of introducing my own children (who are 3 and 5) to programming one wet and windy afternoon.
