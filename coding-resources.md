A curated list of resources for teaching coding to children, from ages 5 upwards. Suggest links in the comments below.

## Key Stage 1 (5-7 Years)

- [“Make a Sandwich” game](http://blog.craigs.me/2014-11-18-comfort-zone.html#following-instructions) - A simple game where the class has to instruct a computer (the teacher) to make a ham sandwich.

- [Run Marco!](https://www.allcancode.com/) - An adventure game in which you must give an intrepid explorer sequences of instructions to reach crystals. It offers a nice step-by-step mode where you can run the instructions one at a time to work out where you went wrong.
- [Lego](http://www.lego.com/) - Any Lego set could be used to introduce the concept of following a set of step-by-step instructions like a computer does.
- [Robot Turtles](http://www.robotturtles.com/) - Board game for kids to learn basic programming concepts. Focuses on sequencing. [Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ThinkFun-Robot-Turtles-Board-Game/dp/B00HN2BXUY).

## Key Stage 2 (7-11 Years)

- [Code Monkey Island](http://codemonkeyplanet.com/) - Another board game for basic programming concepts. Combines aspects such as conditionals, loops, assignment, and strategic thinking.
- [Technobabble](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/games/make-it-technobabble-game-maker) - An online app by the _BBC_ for creating simple games by plugging together different actions and rules.
- [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) - A nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children.
- [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) - A online-only app, much like _Hopscotch_ but far more in-depth in the scope and possibilities.
- [Hour of Code](http://code.org/learn) - Much like _Scratch_ and _Hopscotch_, using a blocks based structure, but with a series of short exercises to introduce concepts gradually, using well known characters.
- [Shaun the Sheep’s Game Academy](http://shaunsgameacademy.co.uk/) - A series of video tutorials and _Scratch_ projects.

## Key Stage 3+ (11 Years+)

- [Codea](http://twolivesleft.com/Codea/) - An iPad app for making any app you can think of. Some of the qualities of Hopscotch and Scratch, but at a much higher level, introducing text-based programming using the _Lua_ language.
- [Cargo-Bot](http://twolivesleft.com/CargoBot/) - An iPad game in which you program a series of robots to move crates to solve puzzles. Created using _Codea_.
