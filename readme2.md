## Computational Thinking

According to the [Center for Computational Thinking](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~CompThink/) at Carnegie Mellon, "Computational thinking is a way of solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior that draws on concepts fundamental to computer science. To flourish in today's world, computational thinking has to be a fundamental part of the way people think and understand the world."
